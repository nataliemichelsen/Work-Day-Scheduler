# Work-Day-Scheduler-
The task was to create a simple one-day (9-5) scheduler that enabled the user to input text for a desired hour slot, save the input to local storage, and save that input if the user refreshed the page. The hour slots also needed to be color-coded to past, current, and future times. 
In order to create this page, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JS sheets and pushed my work to my GitHub repository. 
The HTML served at the structure for the page, housing the time slots, user input fields, and save button. It also linked all relevant pages together and housed the outside links such as bootstrap and moment. 
The CSS enabled the generalized styling of the page and also the color-coding for the hour slots. 
The JS script enabled all functions to work properly, allowed data to be saved to local storage while also saving it to the page, and allowed the Moment.JS information to be implimented.
